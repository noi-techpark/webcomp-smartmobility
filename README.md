Webcomponent - Smart Mobility
============================

Webcomponents meant for displaying different mobility layers which currently are also shown on  http://mobility.meran.eu

## Quickstart

You can download the packaged/build components and include them in your website or link the resources directly by means of a CDN (e.g. [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh)) service.

    <!-- include self-hosted component -->
    <script src="./smartmobility.min.js"></script>

    <!-- include from CDN -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/noi-techpark/webcomp-smartmobility@master/dist/smartmobility.min.js"></script>

Once the component is correctly included, the following custom tag can be used

    <smart-mobility endpoint="https://[SERVER]"></smart-mobility>
